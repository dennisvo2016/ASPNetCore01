This repository contains the source code for the ASP.NET Web API tutorial series by Teddy Smith.
You can follow the tutorial series on [Teddy Smith ASP.NET Web API](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL82C6-O4XrHfrGOCPmKmwTO7M0avXyQKc&si=AJRuJb66l9gHXcMI).

For setting up Swagger and JWT in .NET Core Web API, refer to this [guide](https://teddysmith.io/swagger-net-core-web-api-jwt-setup/).

## Database Configuration

After installing and setting up SQL Server, update the "DefaultConnection" string in `appSettings.json` to match your database configuration.

## Quick Start

Follow the steps below to get started quickly:

1. Open the source code in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the terminal and execute the following command to update the database structure:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
3. Start the server and Swagger interface with:
   ```bash
   dotnet watch run
   ```
   The Swagger interface should automatically open. If it doesn't, navigate to `http://localhost:5281/swagger/index.html` in your browser.
4. Register a new user and log in to obtain a token, which you can use to access other endpoints.
